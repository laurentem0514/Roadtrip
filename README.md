Roadtrip Trivia is a single-player true-false trivia game. The object is to get from New York to California, travelling across Route 80.
In each state, there is a scheduled 'stop' where the player must answer a trivia question within a specified amount of time or the player
is returned to start. If the player answers incorrectly, they are also returned to start.
