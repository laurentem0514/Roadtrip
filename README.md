# Roadtrip

Roadtrip Trivia is a single-player true-false trivia game. The object is to get from New York to California, travelling across Route 80.
In each state, there is a scheduled 'stop' where the player must answer a trivia question within a specified amount of time or the player
is returned to start. If the player answers incorrectly, they are also returned to start. 

Using vanilla JS, jQuery, HTML and CSS, I was able to create a working game.
This project challenged me in many ways - beyond planning, implementation and time-management some of the actual technical challenges 
include syncing a timer, recreating an existing landing page, and making game responsive.

# TO DO
